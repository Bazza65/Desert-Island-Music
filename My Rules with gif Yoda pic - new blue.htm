1. Treat other members with the respect they deserve. This should go without saying, but treat others like you would like to be treated !<br />
<br />
2. The forum language is English only! Please only post in other languages in PM.<br />
<br />
3. Please do not spam. The definition of spam is an irrelevant or advertising post. Any post considered spam will be removed.<br />
<br />

<br />
8. Please be considerate in the language you use on the Island and in the Shoutbox, some of our members are younger than others. Swearing is not completely banned, just do not swear unnecessarily, and only use minor words. A filter is in place to safeguard this system.<br />
<br />
9. No hacking, and illegal activity, such as torrents and illegal downloads, this will not be tolerated, and if appropriate, may be reported to local authority.<br />
<br />
10. Please do not post inappropriate material, I think everyone understands what I mean by this. The policy goes that if you would not feel comfortable viewing it at work, or in front of children or parents, don&#039;t post it !<br />

<span style="font-size: 18px; color:#FFFFFF">What happens if I break a rule ?
</span>
<br /><br />

<span style="font-size: 16px; color:#FFFFFF">Depending on the severity of the infraction, a different course of action may be taken, but the usual practice is as follows :<br /><br />
</span>

<span style="font-size: 14px; color:#FF0003">
1st rule break (Minor offence) :  Corrected, A PM may be sent, no further action taken<br />
<br />
1st rule break (Serious Offence): A warning will be issued, this is a mark against your name letting us know you have broken a rule<br />
<br />
2nd rule break : Another warning<br />
<br />
3rd rule break : On your 3rd warning, you will receive a temporary ban, the length of which will depend on the  severity of the incident.<br />
<br />
On another breach of rules : It will be assumed you will not learn your lesson, so you will receive a permanent ban, meaning you will never be able to visit the Island again.<br />
